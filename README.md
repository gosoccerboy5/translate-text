# Translate Text
Need to be able to translate text at a moment's notice? Never fear!

With this extension, simply select any text to translate, right click it, and select `Translate text`. A handy window will open up with Google Translate in it.

And, when you navigate to the options page, you can select a default language to translate to whenever you open the window. (Of course, you can also change the language when you're on the Google Translate page.)

# Convinced?
## Good! Downloading this is <s>really</s> pretty easy.

Either:
 - Download the source code as a ZIP.

Then unpack the ZIP.
 - Or if you have Git on your computer, run `git clone https://github.com/gosoccerboy5/translate-text`.

Then, once you're done with that, go to `chrome://extensions` and turn on developer mode if it isn't already.

Click "Load Unpacked" in the top left, then select the directory that you downloaded the extension to. It should download successfully for you. 

Try opening a new page or reloading a current page, then selecting some text and then right-clicking it. If you see an option that says "Translate text" in the right click menu, click it and it should open a Google Translate window.

(It will probably only work on non-Chrome pages, and only after you reload a page after downloading the extension.)
